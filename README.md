This is a an express app that rolls the years to the days of web guestbooks.
Data is non-persistent and stored in an array.
The ejs templating engine is used for the app and bootstrap for the front-end

Use 'npm install' to install all dependencies and 'npm start' to start the app. 

This app has also been re-written as https.

Cheers!
